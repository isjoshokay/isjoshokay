# Hi there 👋

I'm Joshua Peoples — a Computational Mathematical Sciences student at Arizona State University, focusing on the intersection of **systems engineering**, **graphics programming**, and **machine learning**.

## 🎮 What I’m Working Toward
I’m aiming for roles that sit at the boundary between **graphics**, **engines**, and **tools** — the parts of technology that power games, simulations, and interactive systems.

I enjoy:
- Building backend systems and services  
- Working with rendering, shaders, and graphics pipelines  
- Designing tools that support creators and players  
- Exploring ML/AI for classification, analysis, and automation

## 🛠 Technical Areas I Work In
- **Languages:** Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, C, MATLAB  
- **Frameworks/Tools:** Node.js, Next.js/Vercel, MongoDB, Socket.io  
- **Math/ML:** K-Means, PCA, statistical classification  
- **Graphics:** Rendering fundamentals, shader concepts, simulation techniques
